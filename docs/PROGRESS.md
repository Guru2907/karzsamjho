## Log

### 13 Nov 2026, 3:10 PM · 2:00 PM gate · agent for lead
- Did: logged the lead's gate test and the work split (D24). Docs only, no product code.
- Files: docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md
- Proof: tested by the lead: a photo in Telegram returned the text card and /check showed the sample data.
- Status in docs/TASKS.md: no change
- Next: 7:30 PM gate: 3 printed ads photographed in Telegram -> Hindi voice + card, twice in a row.
- Broken / risks: the reply is still sample data (no real reading, maths or audio yet); api/data/rbi_dla.csv has only its header row; no printed ads or test offers in the repo yet.

### 13 Nov 2026, 1:30 PM · A1 A2 E1 scaffold (+ D1 skeleton) · agent for lead
- Did: starter repo. Every API route returns sample data; bot sends a photo to the API and replies with the text card; web has 4 routes, top bar, light/dark toggle, and /check shows the sample check from the API. Other api/core files are skeletons that name their task.
- Files: api/, bot/, web/, scripts/, docs/START_HERE.md, .gitignore, .gitattributes, .editorconfig, pytest.ini
- Proof: fresh venv `pip install -r api/requirements.txt` OK · `pytest -q` 6 passed · curl /api/health and POST /api/checks return JSON · `npm ci && npm run build` OK · all 4 web routes render in light and dark with no console errors · `import bot.main` OK · secret scan clean
- Status in docs/TASKS.md: A1, A2, E1 = review; D1 = todo (skeleton only)
- Next: lead pushes to GitHub; everyone clones and runs scripts/setup; then A3 (db), A4 (fallback + cache), B1 (extract), B3 (maths).
- Broken / risks: the bot was NOT tested against real Telegram here (no token in the build sandbox): test it first. Audio and PDF routes return 404 until D2 and F3. shadcn installed its newer "base-nova" style (Base UI under the hood).

### 13 Nov 2026, before 11:30 AM · prep · lead
- Did: created Telegram demo + test bots, Gemini and Groq keys; ran prep/test_keys.py and prep/tg_test.py.
- Files: prep/ (not in this repo); results in docs/PREP.md.
- Proof: test_keys 7/9 PASS (Gemini 3.8 Flash and Gemma 503, both dropped); tg_test PASS (photo in, text + MP3 out).
- Status in docs/TASKS.md: n/a
- Next: A1 repo setup at 11:30 AM.
- Broken / risks: Groq allows about 80 photo reads/day per account; use your own keys while building.
