# TASKS.md: KarzSamjho task list

How to use: pick one task by ID ("Do task B3"). Status is one of: todo, doing (name), review, done. Change the Status line when you start, when it is ready for checking, and when someone else has checked it. Read CLAUDE.md first. Touch only the files listed. A task is finished only when its "Done when" is true on the main branch and someone who did not build it has checked it.

Type: M = must build. S = stretch, only after the 7:30 PM gate on 13 Nov has passed. Nothing new after the 3:30 AM freeze on 14 Nov.

## Right now: the night plan (from 9:00 PM, D38). Owners, order and prompts: docs/PLAN.md "Night plan"

Wave 1 (D40), in order. Gurpreet: B9b, A3, F2, C1, A5, B11. Siddeshwar: F1, C4, F3, D5, then D9, D10, D8, D11. Tejaswini: E2/E3/E9, E6, E4/E5, E8, E7. Anam: G4, G2, G8, G3. Everything else is later; a later task joins wave 1 only if a wave-1 feature would stay incomplete without it.

## Earlier: the 7:30 PM review (re-plan at 4:50 PM, D25)

Owners, order, target times and signatures are in docs/PLAN.md. In scope tonight:
- Lead: A4 (without the cache), A6, A7, B1, B2, B6, B7, B8
- Claude Code teammate: B3, B4, B5, D2, D3, D4
- PWA teammate: E2, E3, E9, E6, E7
- Data teammate: G3, G8, then G1, G2, G4; also I1 (mentor questions) and I3 (backup video)

After the review: owners and order are in docs/PLAN.md, "After the review" (D34). Gurpreet: seconds stamp on the card and A4 now, then A3, A5, F2, F4, C1, C2, F5, no D6/D7 (D35). Siddeshwar: D6 and D7 in full after the 7:30 gate, then F1, F3, D5. PWA teammate: all E tasks. Data teammate: G1 to G4, G8, I1, I3.

Waiting until after the review: A3 (database), the cache half of A4, A5, C1 to C3, D5, E4, E5, E8, all of F.
All changes go through a pull request that Gurpreet merges (D27).

- Rupee receipt: 12 maths tests pass. Across the 30 offers, no wrong number is ever shown as verified.
- Official next step: listed app -> FOUND with lender; made-up app -> NOT_FOUND; near-miss -> SIMILAR. Each verdict gives exactly one next step.
- Harassment log: 10 samples get the expected rules. A forwarded message becomes a PDF in under 60 seconds. Editing a stored entry makes verify fail. A 12-digit number is masked.
